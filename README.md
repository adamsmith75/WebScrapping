### Web Scraping Project using BeautifulSoup and Requests Module

#### Overview:
This project demonstrates a simple web scraping implementation using BeautifulSoup and the requests module in Python. The extracted data is then stored in a pandas DataFrame for further analysis and manipulation.

#### Project Structure:
- **consultancy services (WebScrapping).ipynb**: Contains the Python script for web scraping.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the required libraries for this project.
- **data.csv**: Sample extracted data saved in CSV format.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

#### Installation:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Usage:
1. open `consultancy services (WebScrapping).ipynb` to initiate the web scraping process.
2. The extracted data will be saved in a DataFrame and stored in `consultancy_services.csv`.
3. Use the data for further analysis or visualization.

#### Libraries Used:
- BeautifulSoup
- requests
- pandas

#### Sample Code Snippet:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

# Web scraping code here

# Save data to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_csv('data.csv', index=False)
```
